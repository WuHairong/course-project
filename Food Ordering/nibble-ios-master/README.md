# nibble-ios
The Nibble iOS app. The Nibble web app and API are available [here](https://github.com/gizmosachin/nibble-parse).

## Instructions

`nibble-ios` requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). You can install Cocoapods on your Mac with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then, make sure your working directory is `nibble-ios` and run the command `pod install` in Terminal. Make sure to open `Nibble.xcworkspace` rather than `Nibble.xcodeproj`.
