Simple compiler:  Translate exprs to stack machine insns.

This program using LALR(1) grammar for oc. In order to handle ambiguity, precedence
 and associativity is defined. For TOK_IDENT, some of them are substituted by 
TOK_FIELD, TOK_DECLID and TOK_TYPEID.TOK_FUNCTION become the root of function. 
It contain three children: identifier, parameter list and block. If there is no 
block, the root switch to TOK_PROTOTYPE. Identifier include basetype and DECLID.
PARAMLIST include all parameters. BLOCK include everything inside { }. It include 
0 or more statements. Statement can have other blocks, vardecl, while block, ifelse
 block, return statement and expression. Expression handle all binoperator, uninary
 operator, allocator, function call, variable declaration, constant declaration or
 more expression.
This program will generater three output files: xxx.str, xxx.tok and xxx.ast. Yyparser() is called and dumped into xxx.ast file.
